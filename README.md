Sup honey! ;3 (I know you're reading this)

For some reason, each round only ends in a tie. The mechanic for calculating who won was working earlier, but I somehow screwed it up

Also, in general I feel like this is inefficient. Those elif statements disgust me. I'd love some feedback on how to make it cleaner!
